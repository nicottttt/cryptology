    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ceasar cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Caesar cipher** is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.\n",
    "Eg. if we shift each letter by 3 positions in the alphabet:\n",
    "- plaintext `a` maps to ciphertext `D`,\n",
    "- plaintext `b` maps to ciphertext `E`,\n",
    "- plaintext `c` maps to ciphertext `F`,\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- plaintext `z` maps to ciphertext `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, `crypto` is maped to `FUBSWR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that we always use lower-case letters for plaintext symbols and UPPER-CASE LETTERS for ciphertext symbols.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher uses a very simple key, corresponding to the value of the shift (26 possibilities) and is hence extremely easy to break using bruteforce. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Caesar cipher, is notoriously insecure. The Caesar cipher is a particular case of monoalphabetic substitution cipher. These ciphers preserve a lot of the statistical structure of the plaintext's language.  In particular, the most frequent ciphertext symbols generally represent the most frequent letters of the plaintext (especially when the plaintext is long, so its statistics conform better to general texts in the target language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out which ciphertext symbols represent the **most common letters** of the alphabet is relatively easy.  For example, \"e\" is the most common letter in French and in English, so the most common symbol in the ciphertext probably represents \"e\"! With high probability, the most common letter in the ciphertext corresponds to the encryption of \"e\" and this information is enough to deduce the value of the shift. Eg., if the most common letter in the ciphertext is \"J\" then the value of the shift is almost certainly 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vigenere cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Vigenere Cipher** consists in writing the plaintext in a grid of fixed length and applying a Cesar cipher to each column. Each column is shifted by a different number of positions in the alphabet. The length of the grid and the value of the shift for each column constitute the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: to encrypt `secretmessage` using the key `[3, 1, 6, 18]` (key of length 4) we start by writing the plaintext in a grid of width 4:\n",
    "```\n",
    "s e c r\n",
    "e t m e\n",
    "s s a g\n",
    "e\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1st column: apply a Ceasar cipher of shift `3` (`s`->`V`, etc.),\n",
    "- 2nd column: apply a Ceasar cipher of shift `1` (`e`->`F`, etc.),\n",
    "- 3rd column: apply a Ceasar cipher of shift `6` (`c`->`I`, etc.),\n",
    "- 4th column: apply a Ceasar cipher of shift `18` (`r`->`J`, etc.),\n",
    "```\n",
    "V F I J\n",
    "H U S W\n",
    "V T G Y \n",
    "H\n",
    "```\n",
    "And the ciphertext is `VFIJHUSWVTGYH`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty to decrypt a Vigenere ciphertext is that you do not know the length of the key (ie. the number of columns). Therefore there is two steps in the decryption process:\n",
    "1. finding the length of the key;\n",
    "2. finding the value of the shift applied to each column."
