    "# Decrypting Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers** map individual symbols in the plaintext to symbols in the ciphertext (and back again) using a rule that depends only on the symbol (and not its position, or any other context).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example is the **Caesar** cipher, which maps each letter to its neighbour in the alphabet:\n",
    "- plaintext `a` maps to ciphertext `B`,\n",
    "- plaintext `b` maps to ciphertext `C`,\n",
    "- plaintext `c` maps to ciphertext `D`,\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- plaintext `z` maps to ciphertext `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that we always use lower-case letters for plaintext symbols and UPPER-CASE LETTERS for ciphertext symbols.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher uses a very simple key, but for a general substitution cipher guessing the key is out of the question: there are 26! = 403291461126605635584000000 possibilities!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, substitution ciphers are notoriously insecure.  This is because they preserve a lot of the statistical structure of the plaintext's language.  In particular, the most frequent ciphertext symbols generally represent the most frequent letters of the plaintext (especially when the plaintext is long, so its statistics conform better to general texts in the target language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out which ciphertext symbols represent the **most common letters** of the alphabet is relatively easy.  For example, \"e\" is the most common letter in French and in English, so the most common symbol in the ciphertext probably represents \"e\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few most common letters are usually easy to identify, too (though we might have to try a few permutations among them, since their probabilities are actually quite close and hard to distinguish between).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also detect common combinations of adjacent symbols: in French, \"q\" is always followed by \"u\", but \"u\" is rarely followed by \"q\", so we can look for pairs (**bigrams**) `XY` (say) in the ciphertext such that `X` is never followed by any other symbol except `Y`, and `YX` only rarely appears; such an `XY` would be a good candidate for the encryption of `qu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is painful to compute the symbol and bigram frequencies by hand, so we've written some simple code to do this for you.  And since cryptanalysis necessarily involves (a lot of) **trial and error**, we've also included an interactive solving loop that lets you try setting different candidates, print the results, and undo bad guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more symbols you identify, the more you will see familiar patterns emerge in the plaintext...\n",
    "- The first few symbols are **easy** to find;\n",
    "- the next handful are surprisingly **hard**;\n",
    "- but once you have found them, it will suddenly become surprisingly **easy to finish** the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to **use basic statistics to improve your chances at trial and error**.  You'll need to use a fair amount of intuition for the target language - so if you're a native French speaker, we suggest attempting one of the challenges where the plaintext is in French!"

    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Find the 'e'\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common symbol in the plaintext will almost certainly be `e`...  So:\n",
    "1. Identify the most common symbol in the ciphertext using the frequency tables above,\n",
    "2. run `set X e`, where `X` is the most common symbol in the ciphertext\n",
    "3. run `show` to see where the `e`s appear in the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Find the 'qu'\n",
    "\n",
    "In languages like French and English, `q` is virtually always followed by `u`...  And in French, `qu` is very common (think of \"que\", \"qui\", \"quoi\", \"quand\", ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the `find_qu` command will look for candidate pairs.\n",
    "2. For each pair, `find_qu` will list the pair of ciphertext symbols representing the candidate `qu`, then the number of times this pair appears in the ciphertext.  (If you have already `set` something to map to the possible `q` or `u`, then `find_qu` will warn you.)\n",
    "3. Choose a likely pair (e.g. the top one!): if this is `XY`, for example, then you can run `set X q` and `set Y u`.  Alternatively, `map XY qu` will do this in one command.\n",
    "4. Now `show` the results...\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Find vowels\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaines' method will identify probable consonants: the command `consonants` will give you a useful hint here. It is wise to use it in conjunction with Sukhotin's method that tries to idenfity vowels. The command `vowels` does this and prints tables of bigrams made of vowels, both in the ciphertext and the reference language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In french, finding `qu` is best done finding `ou` at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Try some frequent letters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now look at some other frequent letters, or frequent bigrams, and try to match them up... Each language has its own peculiarities that can help breaking this kind of encryption most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run `show` each time you `set` a symbol**, to see if the partial decryption confirms your suspicions. If you think you've made a mistake, you can always undo it with `unset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints for French\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example: `le` is very common - much more common than `el`, and at this point you've already identifed `e`, so you can try to find `l` in the bigram table...\n",
    "- Similarly, `en` is very common, and `ne` is quite common too... Can you find and match up other pairs?\n",
    "- You can also try matching up some of the more common individual symbols using the frequency tables at the top.  You've already found the easiest letter, `e`, but you can probably identify a handful of candidates for `a`, `s`, `i`, `n`, and `t` (the next five most common symbols in French...)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints for English\n",
    "\n",
    "`th` dominates every other pair, and is much more frequent than `ht`. It is also possible to locate `th?t` or `th?s` or `the?e` or `th?se` and also of course `the`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints for German\n",
    "\n",
    "`ch` is much more frequent than `hc`; followed by `sch`, `ck`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use your eyes (and your brain!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving monoalphabetic ciphers is a **probabilistic** process.  Run `show` frequently, and see if you can spot parts of familiar words appearing in the plaintext.  The further you go, the easier it will get.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If one of your early `set` commands reveals one of the first few letters of the ciphertext, then it might give you an idea for the possible first word of the plaintext.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: suppose you have identified the `e`, and now your partial plaintext starts with `-e--`.  What words might appear at the beginning of a text, with second letter `e`?  `Le...`, `Ce...`, `Cet...`, `Cest...`, `De...`, `Je...`, `Ne...`, all come to mind...  And you may be able to decide which one(s) are more likely to be correct based on the frequency of the first symbol in the ciphertext, and of the bigrams it forms with `e`. \n",
