1. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
Score the skin of the duck breasts and season.
Heat a non-stick frying pan over a high heat, add the duck, skin-side down,
and cook for 4 mins or until the skin is crisp.
Turn over and quickly brown the underside, then transfer to a baking tray.

2. Mix the dressing ingredients together and spoon all but 2 tbsp of it over the duck.
Roast the duck for 10 mins for pink, longer if you prefer.
Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 4 mins, then slice into strips.

3. Toss together the salad, tomatoes, spring onions and duck slices.
Drizzle over the remaining dressing and serve.
